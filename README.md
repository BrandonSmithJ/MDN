# Product Estimation

### About
This repository contains source code for the following papers:

- <i>["Seamless retrievals of chlorophyll-a from Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (OLCI) in inland and coastal waters: A machine-learning approach"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339119073_Seamless_retrievals_of_chlorophyll-a_from_Sentinel-2_MSI_and_Sentinel-3_OLCI_in_inland_and_coastal_waters_A_machine-learning_approach). N. Pahlevan, et al. (2020). Remote Sensing of Environment. 111604. 10.1016/j.rse.2019.111604.</i>

### Usage
The package can be cloned into a directory with:
`git clone https://github.com/BrandonSmithJ/MDN`

The code may then either be used as a library, such as with the following:
```
from MDN import image_estimates, get_tile_Rrs
sensor = "<S2A, S2B, or OLCI>"

# Tile should be the output of an atmospheric correction program e.g. SeaDAS
bands, Rrs = get_tile_Rrs("path/to/my/tile.nc", sensor, allow_neg=False) 

estimates = get_image_estimates(*Rrs, sensor=sensor)
chlor_a = estimates[0]
```

Or, a .csv file may be given as input, with each row as a single sample. The .csv contents should be only the Rrs values to be estimated on (i.e. no header row or index column).
`python3 -m MDN --sensor <S2A, S2B, or OLCI> path/to/my/Rrs.csv`

Current performance is shown in the following scatter plots, with 50% of the data used for training and 50% for testing. Note that the models supplied in this repository are trained using 100% of the <i>in situ</i> data, and so observed performance may differ slightly.
