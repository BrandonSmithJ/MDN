'''
band index algorithm presented by Yang et al.
(2010), which is based on a conceptual model (Gitelson et al., 2008)
that adopts relevant wavebands according to their sensitivity to water
absorption properties
it is assumed R rs (665) has maximum sensitivity to phytoplankton
absorption, R rs (708) is insensitive to phytoplankton absorption but
comparably sensitive to CDOM and R rs (753) is insensitive to phyto-
plankton and CDOM absorption and is mainly influenced by back-
scattering. Chla is estimated from a three-band index using a simple
empirical formula
coefficients a = 161.24 and b = 28.04 have been calibrated for
lakes in Japan and China
