'''
The three-band algorithm developed by Moses et al. (2009) for MERIS,
and adapted by Gitelson et al. (2011) to include Rrs measured at 753 nm;
In theory, the combination of three bands alters the model sensitivity to
the presence of optically active constituents by removing the effects of
SPM and CDOM (R rs (665) and R rs (708) are comparably influenced by
SPM and CDOM and R rs (753) is mainly driven by backscattering).
